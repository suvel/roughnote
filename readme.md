# Roughnote

I find myself placing temporary file all over my Desktop 🤯, to manage
the same I have created this script to clear all the files that are placed in a folder 📁(roughnote). Hope it helps😊.

### Development Description

⚒ The script is written in **powershell** and I have tested this in a **windows 10**.
</br>
</br>
### How to use

Clone the project ,or create the files **click_to_clear.ps1** and **.roughnoteignore** with same filename and extension in a folder (which is intended to contain only temp files) .

When ever you wish to clear the folder **right click** the file **click_to_clear.ps1** and select **run with PowerShell**.- This should clear all files in the folder other then the ones that mention in _.roughnoteignore_
